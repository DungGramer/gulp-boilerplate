# Gulp Boilerplate
This boilerplate can compile your Sass and JavaScript files, import Node modules, optimize images, cache bust, and run a local Browsersync server.  
  
Best of all, it will watch your files and re-run everything every time you make a code change!  
  
Instead of having to do all those tasks manually, `Gulp-Boilerplate` will quickly run them all for you.
